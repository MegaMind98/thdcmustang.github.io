The summary of the post goes here. Just a few lines...



To complete the summary of your blog post, first make a copy of this file and name it date_title.md. Open that file and edit
it (don't edit this original TEMPLATE file).

1. Fill out the above fields: title, medium_url, image_url, image_description, date.

  - `title`: The clickable headline of the blog post. Ordinarily, this should match the title of the post itself.
  - `medium_url`: The full link, including `https://` to the full post.
  - `image_url`: A link to an image representing the post. You should choose an image that is wider than it is tall (i.e. 16:9 aspect ratio). If there is an image in the Medium post, we can link to it on Medium directly. Note that Medium's image link allows us to specify the size of the image, in the `max/xxx` part of the URL. 
  - `image_description`: A short textual description of the image.
  - `date`: The date the post was published, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This field is used to determine which post summaries are shown on the blog summary page.

2. Below the front matter (i.e. after the `---`) is the text that will appear as the summary of the blog. Ordinarily, this can be directly copied from the lede in our Medium post. Generally, this should be one single paragraph, without formatting. It can include links where appropriate. Links can be specified using the Markdown linking format, or by writing `<a>` tags directly.

3. Delete all of this instructional text.

4. Once a file matching this specification is saved into the `_blog_summaries` folder, the `/blog` page will be automatically re-generated to display the most recent summaries, with the most recent post appearing first. If this change is merged to the `gh-pages` branch of the site, the blog page will be updated. 

5. Save and git commit!
